    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Spaghetti is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. 
        It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine.
         Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat, water, and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals. 
        Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum-wheat semolina

    <ol>
        <li>Cut/chop the carrot, green beans, and green pepper to desirable sizes</li>
        <li>Parboil the meat and fish with all the necessary ingredients I like to use just 2 seasoning cubes,

        <li>Break spaghetti to smaller lengths (serviceable lengths) and parboil for 5 to 8 minutes, 
            wash and set aside</li>
        <li>Pick out the Meat/fish when it is soft for consumption, you can choose to fry or not, 
            fry with about 250ml of groundnut oil (you can reduce the oil after frying).</li>
        <li>After frying the fish (you can reduce the oil if it is above 150ml before adding the tomato paste, 
            fry and stir for 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced tomatoes/peppers and onions, fry till the water is dried, this should take about 10-15 minutes. 
            (Remember to stir occasionally to avoid burning).</li>
        <li>Add the meat stock and a cup of water.
            Then add (the ground crayfish, salt to taste then allow to boil).</li>
        <li>Add the spaghetti and cook for about 15-20 minutes till it is almost soft then add the remaining onions,
